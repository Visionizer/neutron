# FILE TYPES

### .NCIN FILES

These are so-called "neutron compiler instructions" files. They are basically the same as .ntn files, but they are **only** used in files concerning the compiler.
They exist for me to be able to differenciate source files that belong to tests, built-in functions etc. and files that belong to the compiler.

.ntn Files do **not** exist within this folder since they do not belong to the compiler.
